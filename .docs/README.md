# Documentation

I want to be able to host documentation in multiple different places

- [ ] crates for libraries
- [ ] [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) for modern man pages
- [ ] a readthedocs page
- [ ] a gitbook page

My goal is to document as much as possible w/ `rustdoc`, and try to prevent managing all of these places simultaneously.
