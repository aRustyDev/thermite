# Thermite

Thermite: A Volatile mixture of Rust + other stuff

Thermite is just my attempt to rewrite Volatility into Rust. My only hope is that this can be used as a microservice version of Volatility for cloud IR kits. I will likely try and make this still work as a cli tool as the classic version has been, but my first priority is cloud native support.
